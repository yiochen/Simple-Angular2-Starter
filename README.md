# Simple-Angular2-Starter
> A dead simple Angular 2 Webpack starter. Originated from the Angular Webpack tutorial

Because it takes so much work to just set up the project with `npm`, `Typescript`, `karma`, `webpack`, etc. 
And most of the starters online are bloated with all sorts of `#coolButIDontNeedIt` setups. 
This is an opinionated setup copied from Angular's webpack tutorial with the following addons:  
- Sass support (not implemented yet)  

This is for my personal use when I just want to test out some Angular component libraries. But feel free to clone it and build your 
project on top of it.

### Requirement  
- npm 3.0   
- node 6.0
